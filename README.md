# Installing the project
This project was built with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) in mind as the means to manage dependencies. You can follow their [https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](install guide) to install it.

Having poetry installed, the following command will install the project into a new environment.

```bash
poetry install
```

Keep in mind that this will by default install the base requirements as well as the dev requirements.

To install the `testing` extras, run:

```bash
poetry install -E testing
```

Remember to commit to the repo the `poetry.lock` file generated by `poetry install`.
